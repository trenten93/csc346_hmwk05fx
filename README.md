# Weather App powered by WeatherUnderground


### Project Description

This app uses the WeatherUnderground API to generate weather details for the zipcode or 
city and state combo and shows the results in the textArea. I added a auto filter combo box and 
the ability to pull and open the radar images from the local radar station and display them 
on the application. 


##### Below are some images demonstrating the project
